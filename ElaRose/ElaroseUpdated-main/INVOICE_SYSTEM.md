# Invoice System Documentation ðŸ“„

## Overview

The ElaRose e-commerce platform now includes an automated invoice generation system that creates professional PDF invoices for both cart checkout and buy-now purchases. This is especially important for cash on delivery orders, providing customers with immediate proof of purchase.

## Features

âœ… **Automatic PDF Generation**: Invoices are automatically generated and downloaded after successful order placement  
âœ… **Professional Design**: Company branding with ElaRose logo and colors  
âœ… **Complete Order Details**: Itemized list with quantities, prices, and totals  
âœ… **Customer Information**: Billing details and shipping address  
âœ… **Multiple Payment Methods**: Supports both Cash on Delivery and Credit Card payments  
âœ… **Unique Invoice Numbers**: Each invoice gets a unique ID based on order ID  
âœ… **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if PDF generation fails  
âœ… **Cross-Platform**: Works on all modern browsers  

## How It Works

### For Customers:
1. Complete checkout process (either from cart or buy-now)
2. After successful payment, PDF invoice automatically downloads
3. Invoice is saved in their browser's default Downloads folder
4. Filename format: `ElaRose-Invoice-{OrderID}-{Date}.pdf`

### Technical Flow:
1. Customer completes checkout in `CheckoutModal`
2. Order is saved to database via `/api/orders` endpoint
3. `generateInvoice()` function is called with order details
4. PDF is created using jsPDF library
5. File is automatically downloaded to user's device
6. Success message shows order ID and confirms invoice download
